Load up some libraries.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)
library(genoscapeRtools)
```

We are going to load up a little function that we will use to estimate the 
rate at which heterozygotes are mistyped as homozygotes from our simple 
model.  The development of this model occurs in a different notebook.

First, we source up the necessary functions:
```{r}
source("R/estimate-m-etc.R")
```

Now, we make a function that will take the name of the study and the name of the population
and then will grab the data, filter it down the popuplation we want, and then feed
it into `esimate_m()` and return the results.  We will also do some filtering to toss out
individuals with more than 70% missing data and 
loci with more than 70% missing data, and also to toss monomorphic loci...

```{r}
#' @param name the name of the data set
#' @param big_pop the string that gives the name of the population
#' @example estimate_het_miscall(name = "red_drum", big_pop = "all_lumped")
estimate_het_miscall <- function(name, big_pop, nreps = 1000) {
  d012 <- read_012(paste0("processed_data/", name), gz = TRUE)
  inds <- read_csv(paste0("processed_data/", name, "_pops.csv")) %>%
    filter(pop == big_pop) %>%
    .$sample
  
  d012 <- d012[inds, ]  # grab just the big population out of there
  
  # get ready to deal with missing data
  miss <- d012 == -1
  # drop individuals with more than 90% missing data (gotta do this for the dolphin data sets)
  d012 <- d012[rowMeans(miss) < 0.9, ]
  miss <- d012 == -1  # recompute data missing in the remaining individuals
  # drop loci with more than 70% missing data.  This will also get rid of those with all missing data.
  d012 <- d012[ , colMeans(miss) < 0.7 ]
  
  # now drop the monomorhic loci. These are loci that are all 0 or all 2
  tmp <- d012
  tmp[d012 == -1] <- NA
  fixies <- apply(tmp, 2, function(x) all(x == 0, na.rm = TRUE) | all(x == 2, na.rm = TRUE))
  
  d012 <- d012[, !fixies]
  
  ret <- list() # get ready to return stuff
  
  ret$filtered012 <- d012  # this will give us the num of individuals and loci.
  
  mest <- estimate_m(d012, nreps = nreps, m_init = 0.1)  # just initialize it at 0.1.  This thing mixes well.
  
  ret$m_tibble <- tibble(pop = big_pop, iter = 1:nreps, m = mest$m)
  ret$overall <- tibble(pop = big_pop, overall_error_rate = mest$overall_geno_err_est)
  ret$simmed_genos <- mest$simmed_genos
  
  ret
}
```

Then we load up the meta-data that tells us which populations we will be using, etc, and we make a list of them
to make it easy to lapply over them
```{r}
meta <- read_rds("processed_data/meta_with_big_pops.rds")

big_pop_list <- meta$big_pop
names(big_pop_list) <- meta$names
```

And then give this thing a whirl
```{r}
set.seed(100)
big_est_list <- lapply(names(big_pop_list), function(n) {
  message(n)
  estimate_het_miscall(name = n, big_pop = big_pop_list[n])
})
names(big_est_list) <- names(big_pop_list)

# at the end, save it:
write_rds(big_est_list, "outputs/big_est_list.rds", compress = "xz")
```

And now we can tidy those up a bit and plot things:
```{r}
trace_tib <- lapply(big_est_list, function(x) x$m_tibble) %>%
  bind_rows(.id = "name")

ggplot(trace_tib, aes(x = iter, y = m)) + 
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ name)
```

So, that shows us that we are  in good shape if we call 1 to 500 the burn-in
```{r, rows.print = 20}
m_post_means <- trace_tib %>%
  filter(iter > 500) %>%
  group_by(name, pop) %>%
  summarise(posterior_mean = mean(m)) %>%
  arrange(posterior_mean)

m_post_means
```

And at the end, let's save that too!
```{r}
write_rds(trace_tib, "outputs/traces_from_mcmc.rds", compress = "xz")
```

And while we are at it, let's write a file of lines 
that will insert png versions of the figures along with estimates
of $m$ into my Rnotebook for the ConGen meeting.

```{r}
outf <- "outputs/notebook-lines.txt"
tmp <- m_post_means %>%
  mutate(lines = paste0("\n\n#### ", name, 
                        ",  $m = ", 
                        sprintf("%.2f", posterior_mean),
                        "$\n\n![](figures/", name, "_big_pop.png)\n\n" ))

cat(tmp$lines, file = outf, sep = "\n")
```
